# Stacks And Queues

### 1. Three in One

> Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stack.

📝 Reminder:

-   The `expand` strategy could be very sophisticated. Maybe extract that part to be an interface.

### 2. Stack Min

> How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function `min` which returns the minimum element?. `push`, `pop` and `min` should all work in `O(1)` time.

📝 Reminder:

-   Extending the `std::stack` seems complicated, so I'm using two stacks to do the implementation.
