# Trees And Graphs

### 1. Route between Nodes

> Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes

📝 Reminder:

-   Classic graph search algorithm.

### 2. Minimal Tree

> Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.

📝 Reminder:

-   A typicial recursive algorithm for tree.

### 3. List of Depths

> Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth.

📝 Reminder:

-   BFS and DFS both work.

### 4. Check Balanced

> Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purpose of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never diff by more than one.

📝 Reminder:

-   Compare left and right subtree's height while recursion is enough, no need to store all the leaves' height and then do diff calculations.
