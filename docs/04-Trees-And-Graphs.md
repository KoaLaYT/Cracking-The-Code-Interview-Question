# Trees And Graphs

### 1. Route between Nodes

> Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes

📝 Reminder:

-   Classic graph search algorithm.

### 2. Minimal Tree

> Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.

📝 Reminder:

-   A typicial recursive algorithm for tree.
