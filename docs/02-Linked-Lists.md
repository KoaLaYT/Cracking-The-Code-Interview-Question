# Linked Lists

### 1. Remove Dups

> Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
>
> FOLLOW UP: How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed.

📝 Reminder:

-   For the follow up, if the result order is irrelevant, we can sort the list and then using two pointers to scan the list, which is `O(NlogN)` time

### 2. Return Kth to Last

> Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

📝 Reminder:

-   Using two pointers seems more straightforward to me than recursive methods.
